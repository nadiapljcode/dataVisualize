Rape is a type of sexual assault which is carried out without a person’s consent. It is an unlawful sexual activity carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person’s will. The term rape is often used interchangeably with sexual assault. Section 375 of the Indian penal code (IPC) defines rape as:

    a)	Against her will.
    b)	Without her consent.
    c)	With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of death or of hurt.
    d)	With her consent when the man knows that he is not her husband, & that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or           believes herself to be lawfully married.
    e)	With her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying on unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent.

The definition of rape is restricted to women but in today’s day and age victims can range from being of any gender to any age. Rape is viewed as a serious offence and the laws of the country try to ensure that the victims are given justice. The legislation has stated that even if the perpetrator is a minor, then that minor will be tried in the court and punished as an adult. One should be aware of the figures of rape in India and should stimulate conversations about it. The one way to raise this awareness among the public is by employing visual tools such as graphs. These visual representations depict the statistics of cases of rape for different age groups.
